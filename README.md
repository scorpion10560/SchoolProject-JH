This Is My Game For School.

It's not a finished game or a good one for any matter, this project / class was made for me to show my understanding of this program.

This game follows that hard rage game style where the controls dont follow the rules you think of when you start it.

The official name of the game is Getting Over It with Jonah Hebert.

I hope you're not harsh with my gradings lol.
